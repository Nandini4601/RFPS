# RFPS (Return Fraud Prevention System)
Final year project


The proposed approach is designed for consumer products, 
utilizing blockchain technology to track items while preserving product 
and supply chain integrity. This approach grants customers the ability to 
follow a product's entire history, from its production to its arrival in their 
hands, through the use of blockchain and QR codes. The primary objective 
of this system is to combat return fraud by offering a transparent and 
verifiable tracking method.
